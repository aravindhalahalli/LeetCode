## Grumpy Bookstore Owner

Today, the bookstore owner has a store open for customers.length minutes. Every minute, some number of customers (customers[i]) enter the store, and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.

On some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy. If the bookstore owner is grumpy on the i-th minute, grumpy[i] = 1, otherwise grumpy[i] = 0. When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are not satisfied, otherwise they are satisfied.

The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not grumpy for X minutes straight, but can only use it once.

Return the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: customers = [1,0,1,2,1,1,7,5], grumpy = [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1], X = 3
Output: 16
Explanation: The bookstore owner keeps themselves not grumpy for the last 3 minutes.
The maximum number of customers that can be satisfied = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 5 = 16.
```

#### Note:

```
1 <= X <= customers.length == grumpy.length <= 20000
0 <= customers[i] <= 1000
0 <= grumpy[i] <= 1
```

```c++
int maxSatisfied(vector<int>& customers, vector<int>& grumpy, int X) {
    int sum = 0, elem, n = customers.size();
    for(int i =0; i<n; i++) {
        elem = grumpy[i] == 1 ? 0: customers[i];
        sum += elem;
    }

    for(int i = 0; i<X; i++)
        if(grumpy[i] == 1)
            sum += customers[i];

    int maxi = sum;
    for(int i = 1; i+X-1 < n; i++) {
        if(grumpy[i-1])
            sum -= customers[i-1];
        if(grumpy[i+X-1])
            sum += customers[i+X-1];
        maxi = max(maxi, sum);
    }
    return maxi;
}
```
