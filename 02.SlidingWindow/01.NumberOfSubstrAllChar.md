## Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters

Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again).
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb".
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
```

```
Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
s only consists of a, b or c characters.
```

```c++
int numberOfSubstrings(string s) {
    int i =0, res = 0, n = s.length();
    vector<int> freq(3, 0);
    for(int j =0; j < n; j++) {
        freq[s[j]-'a']++;
        while(freq[0] && freq[1] && freq[2]) freq[s[i++] - 'a']--;
        res += i;
    }
    return res;
}
```
