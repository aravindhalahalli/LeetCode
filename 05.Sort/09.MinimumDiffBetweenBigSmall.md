## 1509. Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves

Given an array nums, you are allowed to choose one element of nums and change it by any value in one move.

Return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of nums after perfoming at most 3 moves.

 

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
Output: 0
Explanation: Change the array [5,3,2,4] to [2,2,2,2].
The difference between the maximum and minimum is 2-2 = 0.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
Output: 1
Explanation: Change the array [1,5,0,10,14] to [1,1,0,1,1]. 
The difference between the maximum and minimum is 1-0 = 1.
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [6,6,0,1,1,4,6]
Output: 2
```
#### Example 4:
```
Input: nums = [1,5,6,14,15]
Output: 1
``` 
```
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
```
```c++
int minDifference(vector<int>& a) {
    int n = a.size();
    if(n <= 4)
        return 0;
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    return min(
        a[n-4] - a[0],  // Bringing down the biggest 3
        min(
            a[n-3] - a[1], //Bring up one smallest and bringing dow two biggest
            min(
                a[n-2] - a[2],  //Bring up two smallest and bringing dow one biggest
                a[n-1] - a[3]   //Bring up three smallest
            )
        )
    );
}
